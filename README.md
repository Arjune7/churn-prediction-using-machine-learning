# Churn Prediction Model

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn based on historical data. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing for targeted retention strategies.

## Data Collection

The dataset used for this project was collected from [data source]. It includes various features such as [list features] and the target variable, churn.

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.

### Feature Selection
- Selecting relevant features for the model.

### Data Encoding
- Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

### Data Splitting
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Selection

### Logistic Regression
- **Reason for selection:** It serves as a baseline model for binary classification tasks.

### Random Forest
- **Reason for selection:** Random Forests can handle non-linearity and capture complex patterns in the data.

## Model Evaluation

- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate model performance.

## Hyperparameter Optimization

- Grid search and cross-validation were used to optimize hyperparameters for the selected models.

## Model Deployment

- The trained Random Forest model was saved to a file using `joblib.dump()`.
- The model can be deployed in a production-like environment to make predictions on new customer data.

## How to Use

To use the churn prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the prediction script: `python predict_churn.py [input_data.csv]`
4. The script will output churn predictions for the input data.
